## üîç CROSS-CHECK VERIFICATION

### Potential Conflicts Identified and Resolved:
1. **Multiple Mobile UI CSS Files**:

   - Removes slide-out handlers and tab handles
   - Forces fixed positioning with inline styles

3. **Boost Button Functionality**:
   - Original boost functionality preserved through selective override
   - Meter visualization added without breaking boost mechanics

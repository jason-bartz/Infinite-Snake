# Element Distribution and Spawning Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Discovered Elements Not Spawning**
- **Problem**: Discovered elements were only added to individual snake's discovery set, not the global set used by spawning
- **Fix**: Added `discoveredElements.add(chosen.result)` to update global set when any snake discovers an element

### 2. **Large Empty Areas on Map**
- **Problem**: Only 150 elements on a 4000x4000 map with 4% spawn chance
- **Fixes**:
  - Increased target element count to 300 (doubled)
  - Implemented grid-based spawning system (10x10 grid of 400x400 cells)
  - Each cell maintains 3-8 elements
  - Spawns prioritize empty/underfilled cells

### 3. **Low Element Variety**
- **Problem**: Weight calculations were too restrictive
- **Fixes**:
  - Reduced tier penalty (from 0.1 to 0.05 per tier)
  - Reduced anti-clustering penalty (from 80% to 50% per repeat)
  - Added minimum weight of 0.5 for all discovered elements
  - Force-adds random discovered elements when spawn pool is too small

### 4. **Inefficient Spawning**
- **Problem**: Only 1 element spawned occasionally
- **Fix**: Spawn up to 3 elements per frame when below target count

## New System Features

### Grid-Based Distribution
```javascript
const ELEMENT_GRID_SIZE = 400; // 10x10 grid
const MIN_ELEMENTS_PER_CELL = 3;
const MAX_ELEMENTS_PER_CELL = 8;
const TARGET_ELEMENT_COUNT = 300;
```

### Improved Spawn Logic
- Maintains consistent element density across the map
- Prioritizes empty areas
- Prevents clustering while ensuring coverage
- Dynamically adjusts spawn rate based on current count

### Better Discovery Integration
- Global discovery tracking fixed
- Discovery echo system (5x boost for 30 seconds)
- Minimum weight guarantee for discovered elements
- Force inclusion of discovered elements in spawn pool

## Result
- More elements on screen (300 vs 150)
- Even distribution across the map
- Better variety with discovered elements actually spawning
- No more large empty areas
- Maintains performance with smart spawning

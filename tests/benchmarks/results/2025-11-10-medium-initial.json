    "what_these_results_mean": "The extremely high FPS and low draw calls indicate the new system is running but not actually rendering. This confirms the API alignment issue documented in PHASE_3_STATUS.md.",
    "why_fps_is_so_high": "With only 1 draw call (clearing canvas), the rendering completes instantly, resulting in artificially high FPS",
    "what_we_learned": "Benchmark infrastructure is solid and working. The RenderingSystem initializes correctly and accepts render() calls without errors.",

Infinite Snake Element Database Generation

## Project Overview
Generate a comprehensive element database for Infinite Snake with ~30,000 elements progressing from 4 base elements (earth, air, fire, water) through increasingly complex tiers. The database should integrate with the existing infrastructure in `index.html`.

## Technical Requirements

### File Structure
Create these files in the existing project:
1. `elements/elements-database.js` - Main element definitions
2. `elements/emoji-database.js` - Emoji mappings for elements
3. `elements/combinations-database.js` - Combination recipes

### Database Format
Follow the existing infrastructure patterns:
```javascript
// elements-database.js
const elementDatabase = {
  "element_key": {
    name: "Element Name",
    tier: 0-12,
    emoji: "ðŸ”¥", // Reference to emoji database
    category: "natural|life|technology|fiction|concept|culture|sport|meme",
    tags: ["combinable", "base_reactive", "endpoint"] // New: combination hints
  }
};

// combinations-database.js
const combinations = {
  "element1+element2": "result_element",
  // CRITICAL: 95% of later-tier elements MUST combine with at least one base element
  // 3-5 combos per item for tiers 0-4
  // 2-4 combos per item for tiers 5-8
  // 1-3 combos per item for tiers 9-12
};
Combination Philosophy
Universal Combination Rules

Base Element Reactivity: 95% of ALL elements must produce SOMETHING when combined with at least one base element

Fire + [anything] often = burnt/hot/energized version
Water + [anything] often = wet/diluted/marine version
Earth + [anything] often = buried/grounded/mineral version
Air + [anything] often = flying/light/gaseous version


Fallback Combinations: When logical combinations don't exist:

Element + same element = enhanced version OR same element (rare)
Complex element + base = simplified/corrupted version
Fiction element + reality element = crossover element


Discovery Paths: Multiple routes to important elements

Direct path: A + B = C
Indirect path: (A + X) + (B + Y) = C
Theme path: Related elements combine logically



Combination Examples by Tier
javascript// Base combinations (always work)
"pikachu+water": "surfing_pikachu",
"vader+fire": "mustafar_vader",
"smartphone+earth": "rare_earth_minerals",
"happiness+air": "euphoria",

// Same element combinations (minority cases)
"dragon+dragon": "dragon", // 5% chance of same result
"ultimate_power+ultimate_power": "ultimate_power",

// Fallback themed combinations
"master_chief+water": "underwater_level",
"shakespeare+fire": "burned_manuscript",
"bitcoin+earth": "mining_rig",

Special Combination Mechanics
Base Element Reactions
Every element should have AT LEAST one reaction with base elements:
javascript// Tier 10 example - Pikachu
"pikachu+water": "surfing_pikachu",
"pikachu+fire": "burnt_pikachu",
"pikachu+earth": "ground_type_weakness",
"pikachu+air": "flying_pikachu",

// Tier 11 example - Infinity Gauntlet
"infinity_gauntlet+fire": "power_stone_blast",
"infinity_gauntlet+water": "space_stone_portal",
"infinity_gauntlet+earth": "reality_stone_matter",
"infinity_gauntlet+air": "soul_stone_dimension",

// Tier 12 example - The Player
"the_player+fire": "rage_quit",
"the_player+water": "hydration_break",
"the_player+earth": "touch_grass",
"the_player+air": "deep_breath",
Combination Categories

Logical: Makes intuitive sense
Thematic: Related by theme/franchise
Punny: Wordplay-based combinations
Meta: Self-referential or game-aware
Crossover: Between different franchises
Transformative: Changes fundamental nature
Null: Same element (rare, <5%)

Implementation Guidelines
Emoji Selection

Use single, clear emojis that represent the element
Prefer universal emojis over platform-specific
Fall back to symbolic representation if no perfect emoji exists

Naming Conventions

Use snake_case for keys: master_chief, not MasterChief
Proper capitalization for display: "Master Chief"
Avoid special characters in keys
Keep names concise but clear

Cultural Sensitivity

Respectful handling of real people/religions
No offensive memes or hate symbols

Balance Considerations

Equal representation across franchises
Logical progression difficulty
Multiple discovery paths for important elements
Hidden "easter egg" combinations for superfans
Some ironic combinations for humor

Testing Requirements

Verify every element has at least one base combination
Ensure no orphaned elements (unreachable)
Check for circular dependencies
Validate all emoji mappings exist

Quality Metrics

95% of elements combine with at least one base element
<5% return same element when combined with self
Average 3-4 paths to reach any given element
No more than 12 combinations required for any element
All major franchise characters accessible by tier 10

Generate the complete database following these guidelines, ensuring logical progression, comprehensive franchise coverage, and maintaining the feel of discovery and wonder as players combine elements to unlock new ones.

# Infinite Snake üêç‚ú®

A new twist on the classic snake game where you rebuild reality itself by consuming and combining the fundamental elements of existence.

## Story

Reality has shattered. The elements of creation lie scattered across the void. You are the Infinite Snake - a primordial being born from chaos. Consume these fragments, combine them within your endless coils, and forge new existence. From Fire and Water to stars and civilizations, rebuild the cosmos itself.

## How to Play

1. **Collect Elements** - Guide your snake around the map to consume elemental orbs
2. **Combine Elements** - Elements in your body automatically combine to create new discoveries (Fire + Water = Steam, etc.)
3. **Grow & Survive** - Each combination makes you longer. The bigger you are, the more elements you can carry!
4. **Battle** - In head-to-head collisions, the longer snake wins. Running into any snake's body = instant death
5. **Discover Everything** - Find all possible element combinations to master the realm
6. **Watch the Borders** - The borders mean instant death - stay away!

2. Open `index.html` in a browser

## Game Tips

- Your element capacity grows as you eat more elements (starts at 4, maxes at 30)
- When you're full, your snake automatically digests for bonus points
- Death costs you half your score and capacity - but you keep your discoveries!
- Higher tier elements are rarer but give way more points
- Some elements only spawn after you've discovered their prerequisites
- Check the discovery sidebar to track your collection progress

## Technical Stuff

Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and a smidge of CSS. The element database uses a lazy-loading chunk system to keep initial load times fast while supporting thousands of combinations. Game state is saved locally for unlocked skins.

## Browser Support

Works best in Chrome/Edge/Firefox. Safari works but might have some audio quirks. Mobile... technically works but wasn't really designed for it.

## Why I Made This

My son loves snake games and crafting games - he can spend hours on Infinite Craft, Snake.io, Slither.io, Minecraft, etc. I wanted to figure out a way to combine his favorite mechanics from both styles into something new. The goal was to create a fun, pick-up-and-play game that could be enjoyed for 5 minutes or 30 minutes - simple enough to jump into but with enough strategy and control to keep you coming back.

Inspired by: Infinite Craft, Snake.io, Slither.io, Little Alchemy, Doodle God, and the whole genre of crafting games.

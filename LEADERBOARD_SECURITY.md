# Leaderboard Security Updates

## Overview
The leaderboard system has been updated with multiple security measures to prevent cheating and abuse.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Server-Side Score Validation
- **Maximum points per second**: 5,000 (allows for boss kills + combos)
- **Maximum elements per second**: 10
- **Maximum kills per minute**: 30
- **Score overflow protection**: Rejects scores > 999,999,999 or JavaScript MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
- **Minimum play time**: 5 seconds required

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **Per IP**: 5 submissions per minute
- **Per Username**: 10 submissions per hour
- Prevents spam and abuse from single sources

### 3. Username Content Filtering
- Blocks profanity, slurs, and offensive content
- Prevents impersonation (admin, moderator, official)
- Blocks XSS attempts and script injection
- Limits to printable ASCII characters
- Maximum 20 characters

### 4. Data Integrity
- Score entries include timestamp and country detection
- JSON validation before storage
- Re-validation of existing entries during cleanup

### 5. Admin Tools
- Clean suspicious scores: `DELETE /api/leaderboard?action=clean&adminKey=YOUR_KEY`
- View/manage leaderboards via admin script

## How the Exploit Happened

RojokooL was able to manipulate the leaderboard by:
1. Opening browser DevTools
2. Modifying the `playerSnake.score` value directly in the console
3. Calling `submitScore()` with arbitrary values
4. The disabled server validation accepted any score

The "incompatibility" they mentioned was likely submitting a score exceeding JavaScript's MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, causing parsing issues.

## Admin Usage

### Clean Leaderboard
```bash
# Set your admin key
export ADMIN_KEY=your-secret-admin-key

# Clean suspicious scores
node admin/clean-leaderboard.js clean

# View leaderboards
node admin/clean-leaderboard.js view        # All-time
node admin/clean-leaderboard.js view daily  # Today's scores
node admin/clean-leaderboard.js view-all    # All periods
```

### Environment Variables Required
- `ADMIN_KEY`: Secret key for admin operations
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`: Redis connection URL
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`: Redis auth token

## Future Improvements

### High Priority
- Implement proper game session tokens
- Add server-side score calculation verification
- Create mod tools for community management

### Medium Priority  
- Add CAPTCHA for suspicious scores
- Implement shadow banning for repeat offenders
- Add more sophisticated anti-cheat heuristics

### Low Priority
- Machine learning for pattern detection
- Replay system for score verification
- Public API for third-party integrations

## Monitoring

Watch for:
- Sudden score spikes
- Impossible score/time ratios
- Repeated failed validations from same IP
- Unusual username patterns

The system now validates all scores server-side and should prevent the types of exploits that occurred.

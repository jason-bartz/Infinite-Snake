# Element Progression System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a dynamic element progression system that addresses spawn variety, reduces clustering, and better integrates discovered elements into gameplay.

## Key Changes

### 1. Dynamic Progression Phases
The system now adjusts spawn weights based on player progression:
- **TUTORIAL (0-10 discoveries)**: Base elements weight 8, discovered weight 2
- **EARLY (11-25 discoveries)**: Base elements weight 4, discovered weight 4  
- **MID (26-50 discoveries)**: Base elements weight 2, discovered weight 6
- **LATE (51-100 discoveries)**: Base elements weight 1, discovered weight 8
- **MASTER (100+ discoveries)**: Base elements weight 0.5, discovered weight 9

### 2. Anti-Clustering System
- Tracks last 20 spawned elements
- Reduces spawn weight by 80% for each recent spawn of the same element
- Enforces 200-unit minimum distance between same element types
- Prevents repetitive clustering of basic elements

### 3. Discovery Echo System
- Newly discovered elements get 5x spawn rate boost for 30 seconds
- Creates "discovery waves" where players can explore new elements
- Automatically cleans up expired echoes

### 4. Smart Spawn Distribution
- 40% chance to prioritize elements that create undiscovered combinations
- Tier-based modifiers to favor appropriate elements for progression phase
- Maintains existing smart spawning based on carried elements

## Technical Implementation

### New Variables Added
```javascript
let recentlySpawnedElements = []; // Track last spawned elements
const MAX_SPAWN_HISTORY = 20; // Remember last 20 spawned elements
let recentlyDiscoveredElements = new Map(); // Track recently discovered elements with timestamp
const DISCOVERY_ECHO_DURATION = 30000; // 30 seconds of boosted spawn rate
```

### Modified Functions
1. **spawnElement()**: Complete overhaul with progression phases, anti-clustering, and echo system
2. **showCombinationMessage()**: Added discovery echo tracking when new elements are discovered

## Results
- Early game: Players learn with common base elements
- Mid game: Discovered elements appear more frequently  
- Late game: Almost entirely discovered elements, minimal base elements
- No more clusters of the same element
- New discoveries create exciting exploration opportunities

## Testing
Created `test-progression.html` to verify:
- Progression phase transitions
- Anti-clustering weight calculations
- Discovery echo system functionality

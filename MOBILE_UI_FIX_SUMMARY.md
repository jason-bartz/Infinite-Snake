# Mobile UI Fix Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. CSS Custom Properties (Lines 191-209)
- Added CSS variables for dynamic UI positioning
- Variables control scorecard, leaderboard, discovery feed positions
- Variables control opacity for joystick, boost button, and discovery feed
- Variables control boost bar height and spacing

### 2. Consolidated Mobile CSS (Lines 3731-4100)
- Removed conflicting `!important` declarations
- Replaced hardcoded positions with CSS variables
- Unified landscape and portrait media queries
- Removed duplicate "FINAL LANDSCAPE OVERRIDES" section

### 3. JavaScript UI Manager (Lines 14746-14786)
- Created `window.mobileUIManager` object
- `updatePositions()` function dynamically adjusts CSS variables
- `applyMobileOptimizations()` makes discovery feed non-interactive
- Integrated with existing `handleOrientationChange()` function

### 4. Mobile Control Translucency (Lines 3937-3968)
- Joystick background: rgba opacity 0.3 (controlled by variable)
- Joystick knob: reduced opacity to 0.6
- Boost button: rgba opacity 0.6-0.7 (controlled by variable)
- Added backdrop-filter blur effects

### 5. Discovery Feed Improvements (Lines 3754-3761, 3845-3853)
- Scaled down to 0.7-0.75x size
- Added translucency (0.5-0.6 opacity)
- Made non-interactive on mobile to prevent accidental touches
- Positioned to not interfere with gameplay

### 6. Landscape Mode Enforcement (Lines 13184-13195, 13425-13429, 4472-4510)
- Added `showRotateDeviceMessage()` function for fallback
- Locks to landscape when game starts on mobile
- Unlocks orientation when returning to title screen
- Shows rotate device message if API not supported

### 7. UI Element Positions
- **Landscape Mode:**
  - Scorecard: Top-left (10px, 10px)
  - Leaderboard: Top-right (10px from top/right)
  - Boost bar: Top-center (compact 20px height)
  - Discovery feed: Left-middle (scaled 0.75x, opacity 0.6)

- **Portrait Mode:**
  - Scorecard: Top-left (50px, 10px)
  - Leaderboard: Top-right (50px from top, 10px from right)
  - Boost bar: Top-center (compact 18px height)
  - Discovery feed: Left side (scaled 0.7x, opacity 0.5)

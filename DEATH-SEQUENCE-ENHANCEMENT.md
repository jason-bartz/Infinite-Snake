# Death Sequence Enhancement Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the player death sequence to provide a more polished and dramatic experience when the player dies.

## Changes Made

### 1. Death Sequence State Management
- Added death sequence state variables to track the animation progress
- Added 2-second death sequence with multiple phases:
  - 0-200ms: Initial death trigger and particle explosion
  - 200-1200ms: Camera zoom out animation
  - 1200-2000ms: Death message fade in preparation
  - 2000ms+: Show respawn overlay

### 2. Camera Zoom Animation
- Implemented smooth camera zoom out during death (30% zoom out)
- Uses cubic easing function for natural motion
- Automatically resets after sequence completes

### 3. Enhanced Particle Effects
- Added white flash effect overlay for player death
- Extra particle burst with white glowing particles
- Existing death particle system already includes:
  - Multiple particle phases (core, segments, sparkles, elements)
  - Color-matched particles based on snake color
  - Element-based particles if carrying elements

### 4. Delayed UI Display
- Respawn overlay now appears after death animation completes
- Prevents jarring immediate UI appearance
- Maintains game immersion during dramatic death sequence

## Testing
1. Run the game with `node server.js` and navigate to http://localhost:8080
2. Open `test-death-sequence.html` for a dedicated test environment
3. Die in the game to see the enhanced sequence:
   - Watch for particle explosion
   - Notice camera zoom out
   - See delayed respawn screen

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `index.html`: Main game file with all death sequence logic

### Key Functions Updated
- Player death handling in game loop (line ~16013)
- `updateUI()` function to check death sequence state (line ~13234)
- `die()` function with enhanced effects for player death (line ~7459)

### Performance Considerations
- Particle effects already optimized for mobile (reduced count)
- Camera animation uses existing zoom system
- Flash effect removed after 200ms to prevent memory leaks

## Mobile Support
- All effects work on mobile devices
- Particle count automatically reduced on mobile
- Camera zoom scales appropriately (0.5 base zoom on mobile)
